\section{Conclusion}
Tuned mass dampers are used when the original system parameters cannot be optimized for reducing the mechanical vibrations. Even if the parameters is optimized, the desired vibration behaviour might not be achieved. It is a simple and relatively cheap solution. Due to those reasons, TMD's are used at a wide range of applications from skyscrapers to high performance airplanes.
\par In that project, the effects of different types of tuned mass dampers are investigated. Even the simplest form of tuned mass damper can reduce the vibration amplitude by more than 95 \%. It can be seen from the results that double TMD's are more successful at reducing the vibration than the single TMD's. In addition to linear TMD's a nonlinear TMD is also analysed using stepped sine analysis technique.
\par Vast majority of the calculations in that project are made using MATLAB R2020b, Optimization Toolbox and Global Optimization Toolbox. In addition to MATLAB, Mathcad Prime 5.0.0.0 is also used for checking some of the calculations.
